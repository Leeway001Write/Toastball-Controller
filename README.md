# Toastball-Controller
A web app for mobile to remote control a game of Toasterball

## To-do
1. Fix crashing issues: no unresolved errors (try/catch), clean up & delay loops, check if threads (async) need cleaning up.
2. Implement multiplayer - Resolve exceptions preventing multiplayer from working.
3. Create an easier way to connect to the host from mobile, even if IP address has changed (currently IP address is just hard-coded into both index.html and the terminal output from main.go). Maybe create a QR code?
