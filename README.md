# Toastball-Controller
A web app for mobile to remote control a multiplayer game of Toasterball. This was a personal project for me to learn how to use tools like http, web scrapers, pipe servers, etc.

## To-do
1. Test with 4 players (so far only 2)
2. Make P1 keyboard input to reduce strain from virtual controllers
3. Make a remote control for the menu (pre-round, post-round, paused round, etc.)
