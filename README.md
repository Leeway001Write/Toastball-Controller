# Toastball-Controller
A web app for mobile to remote control a game of Toasterball

## To-do
1. Implement Player 2
2. Create an easier way to connect to the host from mobile, even if IP address has changed (currently IP address is just hard-coded into both index.html and the terminal output from main.go)
